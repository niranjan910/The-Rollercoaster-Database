# Project Background

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of global rollercoasters to uncover trends in design, performance, and geographic distribution. Leveraging Python and exploratory data analysis (EDA), it provides actionable insights for amusement park operators, engineers, and enthusiasts to understand ride innovation and strategic planning.

Data Overview:

- Attributes: Rollercoaster name, park location, year introduced, speed (km/h), height (m), length (m), manufacturer, ride duration, and material type (steel/wooden).

- Scope: 1,000+ rollercoasters from amusement parks worldwide.

The Python notebooks used to inspect, clean, and analyze the data can be found here `Rollar_coaster_EDA.ipynb`.
An executive presentation summarizing the results can be found here

# Insights Deep Dive

### Industry Trends:

* **Manufacturing** leads with ~58 counts, followed closely by **Education and Technology**, highlighting strong sector representation.
* **Finance, Telecommunications, Energy**, and **Entertainment** show moderate counts, while **Transportation trails** at ~39, the lowest.
* The color gradient (yellow to blue) reflects count intensity, with a gradual decline and diverse sector coverage, indicating balanced representation without extreme dominance.

### Skill Requirements:

* **Project Management** (12.1%) is the top in-demand skill, followed closely by Cybersecurity and Python (11.7% each).
* **Machine Learning** (10.5%) highlights AI's rising importance, while UX/UI Design, Sales, and Data Analysis (9.7% each) reflect diverse needs.
* **Marketing** (9.1%), **JavaScript** (8.9%), and Communication (6.9%) show a balanced mix of technical and soft skills, emphasizing multidisciplinary demand.

### Location and Remote Work Patterns:

* **San Francisco** leads with an equal split between remote and non-remote jobs, while **Paris** and **London** favor remote roles.
* **Sydney** and **Singapore** lean toward non-remote jobs, whereas **Toronto** and **Tokyo** show near-balanced distributions.
* Remote work is widely available across major cities, but adoption varies by region.

### Automation Risk and Future Growth:

* **AI as a Complement, Not a Threat:** High AI adoption correlates with **lower automation risk** for roles like AI Researcher, HR Manager, and Product Manager, suggesting AI enhances rather than replaces these jobs.
* **Vulnerable vs. Resilient Roles:** While **Marketing Specialist** and **Sales Manager** face higher automation risk due to repetitive tasks, **technical roles (Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Cybersecurity Analyst)** remain low-risk, as AI struggles to outpace evolving demands.
* **Context Matters:** Uncertainty bands (e.g., for AI Researcher) show predictions varyâ€”AIâ€™s impact depends on task adaptability, proving it reshapes jobs more than it eliminates them outright.

# Recommendations

Based on the analysis above, the following actions are recommended:

* Focus learning efforts on AI specializations like Computer Vision, NLP, and AI Strategy to maximize career resilience and salary potential.
* Employers should prioritize flexible remote-first work environments to attract a broader, high-caliber AI talent pool.
* Workforce planners should establish structured upskilling programs to transition employees from high-risk roles to resilient AI positions.
* Policymakers should support AI education initiatives and reskilling programs to prepare the workforce for emerging AI-driven industries.

# Assumptions and Caveats

Several assumptions were made to address data limitations:

* Missing salary values were excluded rather than imputed, as they represented less than 5% of the dataset.
* Some job postings had incomplete skill listings; analyses on skill demand only included complete entries.
* Automation risk estimates were based on third-party machine learning models, introducing potential bias.
* Remote classification was standardized manually where ambiguous descriptions were provided.
